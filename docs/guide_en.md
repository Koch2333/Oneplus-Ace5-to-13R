## For "complete" Conversion (optional)
- Since```my_company.img```and```my_prelaod.img```are not included in the OTA package, the conversion is not "complete".
- Those files are required for pre-installed apps, but they are not necessary for the device to function.
- If you have those files, you can flash them using the same method as```odm.img```.
    ```shell
    adb reboot fastboot
    ```
    ```shell
    fastboot flash my_company my_company.img
    fastboot flash my_prelaod my_prelaod.img
    ```
